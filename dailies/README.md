# SassConf Dailies

> Viewing dailies allows the film crew to see exactly what images and audio 
were captured the previous day, allowing them to make sure there are no 
technical problems such as dirty, scratched, or out of focus film. 
It also allows the director to ensure that they are happy with the performances 
of the actors and that they have captured a scene from all the necessary 
camera angles.
